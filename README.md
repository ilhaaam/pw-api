## Perfect World API

**Note:** Original project by [Tom Irons](https://github.com/tomirons/pw-api), I just continue what he had made.

This package can be used for Perfect World versions: 
``07, 63, 69, 70, 80, 85, 88, 101, 145, 156``

This package still needs a Laravel Setting package like [Efriandika/Laravel-Settings](https://github.com/tomirons/pw-api), but I don't put it in the package requirements for some reason.

If you use Laravel version 5.0 - 5.3 I recommend that you use package [Efriandika/Laravel-Settings](https://packagist.org/packages/efriandika/laravel-settings) version 1.25, you can use the command:
``composer require efriandika/laravel-settings``

If you are using laravel version 5.4 - 5.8 (latest now), you need to use a package [Efriandika/Laravel-Settings](https://packagist.org/packages/efriandika/laravel-settings) dev-master version, you can use the command:
``composer require efriandika/laravel-settings:dev-master``
